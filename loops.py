# This code uses a while loop to check if the number entered by the user is a prime number. The code checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and half of the number. If the number is divisible by any number in this range, the code sets the condition variable to 1 and breaks out of the loop. If the condition variable is 0, the code prints that the number is a prime number. Otherwise, it prints that the number is not a prime number.
